\section{Introduction}
As network attacks grow increasingly sophisticated and diverse, traditional security measures are struggling to keep pace, highlighting a pressing need for more advanced solutions. This paper introduces an innovative intelligent detection tool designed to address these evolving challenges through the creation of a multi-layer network threat graph. The tool analyzes network traffic, event logs from Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), and system logs from monitoring devices to offer a comprehensive view of network security status. This holistic approach enables security analysts to assess network conditions from multiple dimensions, thus enhancing their ability to identify and respond to potential security threats effectively.

The primary challenge addressed by this tool involves the application of advanced artificial intelligence technologies to perform deep analyses of extensive network data. By implementing machine learning algorithms, the tool can distinguish abnormal network packets, pinpoint hosts exhibiting anomalous behaviors, and analyze behavioral clusters. This capability allows for the detection of both known and unknown security threats, including covert threats that might elude traditional security solutions.

Additionally, the intelligent detection tool visualizes complex analysis results in a multi-layered graph. This multi-layer threat graph not only illustrates the connections and interactions between network nodes but also accentuates abnormal events and the distribution of anomalous behaviors. Such visualizations provide an intuitive, easily comprehensible format for security teams to quickly assess the overall security situation of the network, recognize patterns of vulnerabilities, and identify attack behaviors. The graph offers various analytical entry points, facilitating a multifaceted approach to security analysisâ€”whether tracking specific security incidents, studying general network communication patterns, or investigating the propagation paths of malicious activities.

This paper details the design, development, and implementation of the intelligent detection tool, aimed at equipping organizations with a sophisticated, multi-layered perspective on network security. Incorporating cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques, including machine learning, deep learning, and big data analytics, the tool conducts an in-depth analysis of data from diverse sources. Key topics such as data preprocessing, AI analysis techniques, and the creation and visualization of the multi-layer network threat graph are discussed, illustrating the tool's development process, implementation strategies, and practical advantages. This overview provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging multi-layer threat graph detection to analyze and assess the correlation and risk of heterogeneous data.
