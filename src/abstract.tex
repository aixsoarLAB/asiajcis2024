    As cyber threats evolve in complexity and diversity, traditional security mechanisms increasingly fall short. This paper introduces a novel intelligent detection tool designed to offer a deep, comprehensive analysis of emerging threats through the creation of a multi-layer network threat graph. This tool integrates data from network traffic, intrusion detection systems, and system logs, enabling a holistic view of network security. By employing advanced artificial intelligence technologies, including machine learning and deep learning, the tool can identify both known and unknown security threats by analyzing vast datasets to discern abnormal behaviors and anomalous network patterns. The resultant multi-layer threat graph not only visualizes network connections and abnormalities but also enhances the capability of security teams to swiftly understand and react to security risks. This abstract introduces the design, development, and practical application of this intelligent detection tool, highlighting its capacity to transform raw data into actionable security insights through sophisticated AI analysis and visualization techniques. This approach not only aids in immediate threat identification but also supports strategic security planning and risk assessment.
