\subsection{Multilayer and Multidimensional Security Analysis}
The escalating sophistication of network threats has spurred the development of advanced security frameworks, notably multilayer and multidimensional architectures. These frameworks integrate multiple levels of protection, forging a resilient defense against cyber threats \cite{1}. Such architectures feature overlapping defense layers throughout IT systems, ensuring comprehensive protection even in the event of breaches \cite{2}. A prime example of this strategy is the use of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), which monitor network traffic to detect anomalies and mitigate intrusions—thereby safeguarding against data breaches and financial losses \cite{3}.
Further enhancing these security measures, the integration of machine learning and big data analytics has revolutionized threat detection. Tools like IBM’s QRadar and Splunk leverage these technologies to detect subtle threats and expedite incident response times \cite{4}. Recent innovations in this domain include a novel multi-stage IDS that utilizes a simplified Cyber Kill Chain model along with Graph Neural Network (GNN) algorithms. This approach has been particularly effective in detecting complex, evolving attacks, significantly enhancing detection capabilities and reducing false positives in critical sectors such as finance and government \cite{5, 6}.

\subsection{Artificial Intelligence in Network Security}
As network environments grow increasingly complex with the proliferation of 5G and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, traditional security measures are becoming inadequate. This research explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques in developing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that effectively counters sophisticated cyber threats, such as Krack and Kr00k attacks targeting IEEE 802.11 protocols. Leveraging the AWID3 dataset, our ML models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness, achieving a 99% detection rate for Krack attacks and a 96.7% success rate for identifying Kr00k threats, underscoring the robust potential of ML to enhance network security \cite{8,9}.

% \subsection{Overview of Existing Network Security Analysis Techniques}
% The landscape of network security is diverse, encompassing a range of techniques developed to protect information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This subsection provides an overview of traditional security measures and discusses their limitations in the face of evolving threats.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Traditional Network Security Methods:} Traditional security mechanisms such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) form the first line of defense in network security. Firewalls control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules, while IDS and IPS analyze network traffic to detect and potentially stop attacks.

%     \item \textbf{Limitations of Traditional Methods:} While effective against many standard threats, these traditional tools often fall short when confronting more sophisticated attacks like Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. APTs, which are complex, stealthy, and sustained, exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to a network and remain undetected for a long period. On the other hand, DDoS attacks overwhelm systems by flooding them with traffic, which not only evades but often incapacitates traditional security mechanisms.

%     \item \textbf{Inadequacy in Dynamic Threat Landscape:} The dynamic nature of modern cyber threats requires more adaptive and proactive security solutions. Traditional tools, with their dependency on predefined rules and signatures, are not equipped to handle zero-day exploits or rapidly mutating malware, leaving systems vulnerable to new and emerging threats. This necessitates an evolution towards more intelligent and responsive security systems that can predict, detect, and respond to threats in real-time.
